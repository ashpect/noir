# `noir_wasm_cli`

This is a basic CLI to compile noir projects using `@noir-lang/noir_wasm`. It's designed to help test equivalence between `@noir-lang/noir_wasm` and `nargo` and should not be used in production.

We strongly encourage using `nargo` instead of the wasm compiler in commandline contexts.
